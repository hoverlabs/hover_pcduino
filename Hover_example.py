#  This is an example for Hover. 
#  
#  Hover is a development kit that lets you control your hardware projects in a whole new way.  
#  Wave goodbye to physical buttons. Hover detects hand movements in the air for touch-less interaction.  
#  It also features five touch-sensitive regions for even more options.
#  Hover uses I2C and 2 digital pins. It is compatible with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and more.

#  OUTPUT DEFINITION
#  The message variable outputs an 8-bit binary value to indicate the event type, gesture direction, and tap location.  
#  Upper 3 bits indicates the event type: gesture or tap.
#  Lower 5 bits indicates the gesture direction or tap location. 
#
#    EVENT TYPE     DIRECTION 
#       000           00000
#  ---------------------------------------------------------
#    GESTURES       DIRECTION FOR GESTURE
#       001            00010 - Right Swipe

#                      01000 - Up Swipe 
#                      10000 - Down Swipe
